## Content

Here we present description of B-SCITE software and detais about running ddClone, OncoNEM and SCITE used in the benchmarking.

## Description
--------------


**B-SCITE** is a software package to compute trees of tumor evolution by integrative use of single-cell and bulk sequencing data. Full details about the use of the software will be added in the following days.

## Input data
-------------

Input to B-SCITE consists of single-cell matrix, which is ternary matrix of dimension nxm, where n denotes number of mutations and m denotes number of single cells obtained in sequencing experiment, and bulk sequencing derived matrix containing details about read counts for each of n mutations. Entries of single cell matrix are 0,1 and 3, coding respectively for absence, presence or missing value for mutation calls.
